# IPL-Auction
OOPS project to demonstrate inheritance and file reading concepts 
Bid for IPL auction, a C++ application that implements all the rules of auction for IPL, using object oriented programming concepts and file system. Users can then compete with other teams with some restrictions which depend on the team chosen by the user in accordance with IPL rules like the maximum number of players, foreigners, etc.
